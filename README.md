#Key Features of JavaScript

Lightweight and Interpreted:

Executed directly in the browser without the need for compilation.
Ideal for making web pages interactive.
Event-Driven:

Supports event handling, enabling developers to respond to user actions like clicks, keypresses, and mouse movements.
Dynamic Typing:

Variable types are determined at runtime, providing flexibility but requiring careful handling of type-related errors.
Functional and Object-Oriented:

Supports functions as first-class citizens.
Allows creation and manipulation of objects.
Platform-Independent:

Runs on any device or platform with a JavaScript engine, such as browsers or server environments like Node.js.
Asynchronous Programming:

Features like Promises, async/await, and callbacks support non-blocking operations.
Common Uses
Front-End Development:

Create interactive elements such as sliders, forms, modals, and animations.
Frameworks/Libraries: React, Vue.js, Angular.
Back-End Development:

Server-side programming with Node.js.
Build RESTful APIs, manage databases, etc.
Web APIs:

Work with browser APIs like the DOM, Fetch API, Geolocation, and more.
Mobile App Development:

Frameworks like React Native and Ionic enable cross-platform mobile development.
Game Development:

2D/3D games using libraries like Three.js, Phaser.
